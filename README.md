# Nemo and W&B workshop

- Training `FastPitch` is working on the 5 minutes of audio. Should we make this longer? It takes like 2 minutes on modern GPU

- Table alongside model predictions can be seen [here](https://wandb.ai/capecape/nemo?workspace=user-capecape)
- Finetuning HiFi-GAN **is not** working for me.
